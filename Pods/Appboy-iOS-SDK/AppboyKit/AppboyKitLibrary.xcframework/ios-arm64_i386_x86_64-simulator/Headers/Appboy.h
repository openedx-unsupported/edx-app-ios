 *        communication policy is to perform immediate server requests when user facing data is required (new in-app messages,
 *        feed refreshes, etc.), and to otherwise perform periodic flushes of new analytics data every few seconds.
 *        The interval between periodic flushes can be set explicitly using the ABKFlushInterval startup option.
 *   ABKAutomaticRequestProcessingExceptForDataFlush - Deprecated. Use ABKManualRequestProcessing.
 *   ABKManualRequestProcessing - The same as ABKAutomaticRequestProcessing, except that updates to
 *        custom attributes and triggering of custom events will not automatically flush to the server. Instead, you
 *        must call flushDataAndProcessRequestQueue when you want to synchronize newly updated user data with Braze. Note that
 *        the configuration does not turn off all networking, i.e. requests important to the proper functionality of the Braze
 *        SDK will still occur.
 *
 * Regardless of policy, Braze will intelligently combine requests on the request queue to minimize the total number of

/*!
* @param userId The new user's ID (from the host application).
*
* @discussion
* This method changes the user's ID.
*
* When you first start using Braze on a device, the user is considered "anonymous". You can use this method to
* optionally identify a user with a unique ID, which enables the following:
*
*   - If the same user is identified on another device, their user profile, usage history and event history will
*     be shared across devices.
*
*   - If your app is used by multiple people, you can assign each of them a unique identifier to track them
*     separately. Only the most recent user on a particular device will receive push notifications and in-app
*     messages.
*
*   - If you identify a user which has never been identified on another device, the entire history of that user as
*     an "anonymous" user on this device will be preserved and associated with the newly identified user.
*
*   - However, if you identify a user which *has* been identified on another device, the previous anonymous
*     history of the user on this device will not be added to the already existing profile for that user.
*
*   - Note that switching from one an anonymous user to an identified user or from one identified user to another is
*     a relatively costly operation. When you request the
*     user switch, the current session for the previous user is automatically closed and a new session is started.
*     Braze will also automatically make a data refresh request to get the news feed, in-app message and other information
*     for the new user.
*
*  Note: Once you identify a user, you cannot go back to the "anonymous" profile. The transition from anonymous
*  to identified tracking only happens once because the initial anonymous user receives special treatment
*  to allow for preservation of their history. We recommend against changing the user id just because your app
*  has entered a "logged out" state because it separates this device from the user profile and thus you will be
*  unable to target the previously logged out user with re-engagement campaigns. If you anticipate multiple
*  users on the same device, but only want to target one of them when your app is in a logged out state, we recommend
*  separately keeping track of the user ID you want to target while logged out and switching back to
*  that user ID as part of your app's logout process.
