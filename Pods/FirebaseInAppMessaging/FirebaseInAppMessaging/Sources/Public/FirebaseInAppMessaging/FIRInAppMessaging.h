/**
 * The root object for in-app messaging iOS SDK.
 *
 * Note: Firebase InApp Messaging depends on using a Firebase Instance ID & token pair to be able
 * to retrieve FIAM messages defined for the current app instance. By default, Firebase in-app
 * messaging SDK would obtain the ID & token pair on app/SDK startup. As a result of using
 * ID & token pair, some device client data (linked to the instance ID) would be collected and sent
 * over to Firebase backend periodically.
 *
 * The app can tune the default data collection behavior via certain controls. They are listed in
 * descending order below. If a higher-priority setting exists, lower level settings are ignored.
 *
 *   1. Dynamically turn on/off data collection behavior by setting the
 *     `automaticDataCollectionEnabled` property on the `FIRInAppMessaging` instance to true/false
 *      Swift or YES/NO (objective-c).
 *   2. Set `FirebaseInAppMessagingAutomaticDataCollectionEnabled` to false in the app's plist file.
 *   3. Global Firebase data collection setting.
